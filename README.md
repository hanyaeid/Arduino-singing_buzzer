# Arduino-singing_buzzer

This is a simple project I started to improve my Arduino skills. It involves a simple buzzer that has been programmed to hum out the tune of a song by humming out certain frequencies at certain intervals.
Currently, the code is functional, but there is no specific song yet.

The hardware used so far includes:
-ELEGOO UNO R3 microcontroller
-Jumper wires (6)
-5V Piezoelectric buzzer
-220 ohm resistor
-Breadboard
